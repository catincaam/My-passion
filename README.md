I developed a simple iOS app in Swift that displays a series of images from my personal vacations. The app features a button on the screen that, when pressed, randomly cycles through and displays different images, creating a slideshow effect.
What I learned:
* UI Interaction: Learned how to work with UIButton and handle user actions using functions like IBAction.
* Image Handling: Gained experience in adding and displaying images within an app using UIImageView.
* Flow Control: Improved my understanding of dynamically changing content using arrays and basic Swift functionalities.
* Xcode and iOS Project Structure: Became familiar with navigating Xcode, working with the storyboard, and understanding the structure of an iOS project.
